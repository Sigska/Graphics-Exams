#Graphics-Exams
 - Sigska

The project is a cMaked from lab2 and I linked in assimp for modelloading, by also using cMake. (Followed a tutorial).

Work:

I started following this tutorial https://www.3dgep.com/multi-textured-terrain-in-opengl/, but as I progressed working with it I ended up with a lot of issues.
Linking being one of them.

I then switched over to something different, using cmake on lab2. I happened to get in some really obnoxious linking error and spent a bit long time dealing with that.

The heightmap is an obj created and exported from blender.  

Credits:
I got a lot of help from learnopengl.com and support from askelej aswell as many other tutorial videos on youtube.  


How to play:

Q and E increases / decreases the speed of the plane. You can turn the camera to the sides with J and L, and up and down with I and K.
